# PRODIGY_DS_01

# Internship Task 1

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize population data  for various countries. Specifically, the analysis identifies the top 10 and bottom 10 countries based on their male and female population in a given year. The project includes data extraction, transformation, and visualization using Python libraries.  The problem statement is :-"Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population."

## Dataset

The dataset contains population data for different countries over several years. The columns in the dataset are as follows:
- `Series Name`
- `Series Code`
- `Country Name`
- `Country Code`
- Population data for years ranging from 2001 to 2022.

The key series names used for this analysis are:
- `Population, male`
- `Population, female`

## Project Structure

- `worldpopulation.csv`: The dataset file containing population data.
- `PRODIGY_DS_01.ipynb`: The main Python script that performs data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This README file explaining the project details.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

### 2. Data Filtering and Transformation

- The data is filtered to extract population data for males and females.
- The data is then pivoted to create separate DataFrames for male and female populations with countries as rows and years as columns.
- The two DataFrames are merged to facilitate analysis.

### 3. Analysis

The analysis involves identifying the top 10 and bottom 10 countries based on their male and female population for the year 2022.

### 4. Visualization

Bar charts are created to visualize the population data for the top 10 and bottom 10 countries by gender:
- Top 10 countries by male population.
- Bottom 10 countries by male population.
- Top 10 countries by female population.
- Bottom 10 countries by female population.


#Results


The results of the analysis include bar charts that show the population distribution by gender for the top 10 and bottom 10 countries. These visualizations provide insights into the population demographics of different countries.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to process, analyze, and visualize population data by gender using Python. The approach can be extended to other years or datasets to gain further insights into population dynamics.

## Usage
